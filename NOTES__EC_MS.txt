-------------------- 17E17 ------------------------------------------
Datapoints module extended and improved to fascilitate organization and reorganization of derived values.
Additions in data_importing for removing bad data values (-1's generated by acquisition)
Data column 'loop number' now included in data files based on info in .mpt headers


-------------------- 17C23 ------------------------------------------
Lots of small improvements and additions that came with writing paper, grading surface science, etc
Extended electrolytes module in prep for ambitions electrochemical mass transport modelling.

-------------------- 17B21 ------------------------------------------
Upgrade to plot_vs_potential
Standard color scheme implemented, mols and masses can be lists rather than dicts in plotting functions
sync_metadata protected

-------------------- 17A28 ------------------------------------------
Added Electrolytes module to implement all the electrolyte modelling in Scott's thesis Seciton 3.1, generalized to use with any electrolyte.
./data/Electrolytes.txt has data to interface with 'Electrolyte' class, among other things pKa's and ion mobilities for a number of common electrolytes.
Tafel plots made easy with functions 'get_datapoints' in Integrate_Signals module and 'plot_datapoints' in Plotting module 


-------------------- 17A12 ------------------------------------------
Lots of small improvements and additions, mostly in the area of better integrating quantification in all of the older scripts.


-------------------- 16L15 ------------------------------------------
Put it all together and got serious about quantification. Now we just need more calibrations!

'Quantification' module added with functions for comparing calibration factors generated in 'Calibration' module with literature values and extrapolating calibrating factors for other molecules.
Expanded molecular database and added QMS spectra from NIST, ionization cross sections at 100eV, RSF's from Hiden, and extrapolated F_cal's for molecules 
'get_flux', and 'predict_current' functions added to 'Quantification', all using the F_cal for the molecule's primary mass. 
'plot_flux' added to Plotting. 'plot_masses' renamed 'plot_signal'.
'plot_experiment' modified to plot fluxes in nmol/s rather than QMS signal if given parameter 'mols={<molecule1>:<color1>, ...}'.
Integration of transient fixed 


-------------------- 16K17 ------------------------------------------
Object_Files module added to facilitate interaction of objects (of i.e. Molecule) with databases. Molecules module adjusted accordingly.
Calibration module added, cal_ML_strip and cal_steady_state written. Calibration functions added to Molecules.
O2, H2, CO2, and Cl2 calibrated from CP and CO stripping experiments. Results all (automatically!) saved in ./data/


-------------------- 16J29 ------------------------------------------
Improved 'synchronize' to append data from multiple EC and/or MS files
Added import_folder to Data_Importing.
plot_masses_and_I renamed plot_experiment


-------------------- 16J27 ------------------------------------------
Time_Response module added to model mass transport in working volume and fit signal shapes
Molecules module added to interact with a database (./data/) for quantification
Several functions added to EC, including CV_difference for e.g. CO stripping, and sync_metadata to deal once and for all with RE_vs_RHE and A_el. 
functions in Plotting and Combining updated accordingly


-------------------- 16I29 ------------------------------------------
Plotting functions moved to their own module
plot_masses_and_I uses tspan_2 by default
numerize is now done automatically when import_data is called
plot_vs_potential added to Plotting
remove_delay added to EC
text_to_data protected against commas as decimals. I hate commas as decimals.
np.where() replaced by a list comprehension in plot_masses
Implemented a few minor changes suggested 16I23 (see Improvements file)


-------------------- 16I23 ------------------------------------------
Modified 16I23 so that EC_MS performs better as a cross-platform package.
16I23 modifications make the package compatible with Windows and with python2, in addition to the intended python3 on Linux.
Most of the modules have an "if __name__=='__main__':" part that demonstrates the usage of some of its functions.
The modules can be run from within the package, or, as is the main intention, imported with the EC_MS package. This is done with a "from EC_MS import ..." statement in a script. In the folder Experiment sketched below, plot_01.py would import functions from EC_MS and use them to operate on the data in MS_data.txt and EC_data.mpt to generate plot_01.png
